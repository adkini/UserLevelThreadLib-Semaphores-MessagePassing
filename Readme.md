# Thread Library-Semaphores-Message Passing.

Contains four applications based concepts in distributed Multiprocessing operating systems. e.g (Threads, Semaphores etc)

This module implements a user level thread scheduler.

This module contains routines that implements semaphores and then use them to implement the readers/writers problem.

This module contains code that does message passing via ports. Implementation strategies: Strategy 1: A mutex semaphore for all ports, and a producer semaphore and a consumer semaphore - per port Strategy 2: Same as 1, but a mutex per port.
